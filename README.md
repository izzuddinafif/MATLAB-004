# MATLAB-004: Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for solving an optimization problem using a hybrid approach combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The project is designed to be easily adaptable to different optimization problems.

## Features

- Utilizes genetic algorithm for optimizing variables.
- Employs particle swarm optimization for accelerating convergence.
- Displays convergence graph with the best fitness values at each iteration.
- Code is easily modifiable to accommodate different optimization problems.
