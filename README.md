## MATLAB-004: Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization

This repository contains an implementation of a hybrid algorithm between Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in MATLAB. The goal of this project is to optimize a given function using a combination of GA and PSO techniques.

### Features

- Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization
- Customizable parameters for GA and PSO
- Fitness function evaluation
- Roulette Wheel Selection for GA
- Crossover and mutation operations for GA
- Position and velocity updates for PSO
- Convergence plot of best fitness values

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/izzuddinafif/MATLAB-004.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd MATLAB-004

3. Run the main script `main.m` in MATLAB.

### Customization

You can modify the parameters for GA and PSO in the `main.m` script, such as population size, maximum number of iterations, crossover probability, mutation probability, and more. You can also change the fitness function by updating the `hitung_fitness` function.
